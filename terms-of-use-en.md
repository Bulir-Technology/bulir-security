  <li>API USAGE TERMS
    <br/>
    <ol>
      <li>
        An API, or "Application Programming Interface," is the set of instructions, routines, and programming standards that allow access to a software application or online platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        APIs facilitate agility and efficiency in integrations, allowing information to be exchanged securely and easily, both for those who make the data available and for those who use it.
      </li>
      <li>
        APIs optimize internal management, offering practical tools and a solid database, making it easier and better to control routine processes and company strategies.
      </li>
      <li>
        The use of APIs enables commercial agreements with payment intermediaries, among other services. When a customer buys goods or requests a service on a website, for example, before the transaction is confirmed, the API sends the card details to a remote application, which checks the information and sends a response so that the seller can confirm the purchase.
